# XonixGame-implement-cpp-and-sfml
cool game if you are bored and have no ideas for the code, in this game I designed the code quite well, that is, the functions, logic and code construction are also not bad, I think so. In order to run this project without problems, you need to add files from the px folder that I also left.
